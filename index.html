        <h1>G-eazy - Summer in december</h1>
       	<p>Welcome to LA<br>
       	 The land of opportunity where everybody stay<br>
    		 The girls are pretty, sun will shine three-hundred-sixty days<br>
     		 But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray<br>
    		 Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away<br>
         The land of opportunity where everybody stay</p>
  		
  		  <!-- SECOND PART -->	

  		  <p>Yeah<br>
  		  They move out to this town where dreams, ambitions, and get lost in the party<br>
  		  Takes a toll on you, man, this shit will charge a large fee<br>
  		  Just don't forget who you are, G<br>
  		  Staring at the man in the mirror, like I recognize him hardly<br>
  		  Burn my sins away and twist some parsley<br>
  		  Stop and chill, these days I do it sparsely<br>
  		  In another universe I coulda had a stroller and a car seat, word<br>
  		  They tell me things will happen how they s'pposed to<br>
  		  But somehow it seems I hurt all the people I get close to<br>
  		  Experiencing breakdowns at twenty-seven goes through<br>
  		  'Cause you don't want to see heaven yet, where Janis Joplin knows you<br>
  		  On phone calls with Mama like she tryin' to give me a earful<br>
  		  She said "This is the town that happens in so just be careful<br>
  		  And try and keep your head straight<br>
  		  And dead-off all that bullshit, that's just dead weight"<br>
  		  Yeah
  		  </p>
  		  <p>
  		  Welcome to LA<br>
  		  The land of opportunity where everybody stay<br>
  		  The girls are pretty, sun will shine three-hundred-sixty days<br>
  		  But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray<br>
  		  Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away<br>
  		  The land of opportunity where everybody stay</P>

        <!-- THIRD PART -->

        <p>The whole world's outside knocking at my door like "Gerald, where the fuck that album at?"<br>
        But I ain't home, I'm on the road, the stage is where they found me at<br>
        So my personal interest, take a backseat to the business<br>
        But I balance like a gymnast, like Simone in the Olympics<br>
        So please pardon my tardiness, I'm tryin' to put my heart in this<br>
        Give this shit my everything, every time when I start with this<br>
        Hungry for the world, thatâ€™s why I starve for this<br>
        Yeah, artists come and go these days it's easy, they're not hard to miss<br>
        Here today, gone tomorrow, they fade into a dark abyss<br>
        Hollywood sold you a dream, like how the fuck you fall for this?<br>
        Have to know yourself or you just really gon' get lost in this, sauce<br>
        I really paid the cost to be a boss<br>
        I paid in cash and skipped the tax, ain't asked for no receipt<br>
        When I get stressed I play the beat and split a Swisher Sweet<br>
        Damn, yeah, uh
        </p>
        <p>
        Welcome to LA<br>
