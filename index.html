     		<!-- FIRST PART -->
     	<p>Welcome to LA
     	 The land of opportunity where everybody stay
  		 The girls are pretty, sun will shine three-hundred-sixty days
   		 But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
  		 Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
       The land of opportunity where everybody stay</p>
		
		  <!-- SECOND PART -->	

		  <p>Yeah
		  They move out to this town where dreams, ambitions, and get lost in the party
		  Takes a toll on you, man, this shit will charge a large fee
		  Just don't forget who you are, G
		  Staring at the man in the mirror, like I recognize him hardly
		  Burn my sins away and twist some parsley
		  Stop and chill, these days I do it sparsely
		  In another universe I coulda had a stroller and a car seat, word
		  They tell me things will happen how they s'pposed to
		  But somehow it seems I hurt all the people I get close to
		  Experiencing breakdowns at twenty-seven goes through
		  'Cause you don't want to see heaven yet, where Janis Joplin knows you
		  On phone calls with Mama like she tryin' to give me a earful
		  She said "This is the town that happens in so just be careful
		  And try and keep your head straight
		  And dead-off all that bullshit, that's just dead weight"
		  Yeah
		  </p>
